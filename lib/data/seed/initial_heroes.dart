    'biography': '''Abu Bakr As-Siddiq was the closest friend and companion of Prophet Muhammad and the first caliph of Islam. Born in Mecca to a merchant family, he was among the earliest converts to Islam and earned the title "As-Siddiq" (The Truthful) for his immediate acceptance of the Prophet's night journey (Isra and Mi'raj).

During the early days of Islam, Abu Bakr used his wealth to free Muslim slaves who were being persecuted. He accompanied Prophet Muhammad during the crucial migration (Hijra) from Mecca to Medina, hiding in the Cave of Thawr.

As caliph, he demonstrated remarkable leadership during a critical period, successfully preserving the unity of the Muslim community after the Prophet's death. His brief but impactful rule laid the foundation for the Islamic state's expansion.''',
